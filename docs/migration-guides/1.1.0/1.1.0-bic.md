| packages/theme/helpers/cart/addToCart.ts                                                   | GroupedProductâ€™s add-to-cart URL resolution is simplified and replaced with the getProductPath. |
| packages/theme/modules/catalog/category/components/views/useProductsWithCommonCardProps.ts | Product link URL resolution is simplified and replaced with the getProductPath. |
| packages/theme/modules/customer/pages/MyAccount/MyWishlist.vue                             | Product link URL resolution is simplified and replaced with the getProductPath. |
| packages/theme/modules/catalog/product/components/ProductsCarousel.vue                     | Product link URL resolution is simplified and replaced with the getProductPath. |

***Notes:*** If you are using in your project old, prefixed URL or URL resolvers, replace them with the usage of the new **useProduct::getProductPath**

***Notes:*** The old routing system is replaced with a Magento route **type** resolver. Previously, VSF was able to route to a CMS, Category, or Product page based on the URL prefix. Currently, the renderer type is resolved based on the GraphQL **route** query and the route **type** field.
